                How to Start Career as Full Stack Developer?

                I used to think that you were either a web designer or a web developer. Or maybe you were one of those rare unicorns who did both. But either way, you either worked on the design of the site, or the code that made it work. And then I started seeing all these job listings asking for “front end developers” or “back end developers” and even “full stack developers.” Um. What the heck is a full stack developer?

As the Web has grown more complex and as more becomes possible on the Internet, developers have gotten more specialized. That means that web development now means a lot of different things depending on what a web developer specializes in. Here are the three main categories:

    front end development (the visible parts of a website or app)
    back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)
    full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to a web stack, mobile stack, or a native application stack (i.e. software programs for specific devices)

To understand what each of the web developer specialties (or in the case of full stack web developers, non-specialties) are, we’ve created a guide breaking them all down, along with the skills you need to learn to become a full stack developer—if that’s your thing.

Read on for more insight into what front end, back end, and full stack developers do (and why the lines between them are getting really blurry).

            <h2>What is a Front End Developer?</h2>
            <p>
                Front end developers build the visible parts of websites that users see and interact within their web browsers.<br/>The front end of a website (or web or mobile application) is the part a user sees and directly interacts with. The front end is built with languages like:
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the Web. Every website you visit is built with HTML. It takes care of all the structure and content. HTML5 is the current iteration of HTML on the Web, although sites built with older versions still run fine in your browser.
                <br>
                <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is what controls the way the HTML looks on the page. 
                <br>
                <b>CSS</b> sets the colors, fonts, background images, and even the way the page is laid out (you can use CSS to arrange the HTML elements on a page however you want, even if it’s different than the order they’re arranged in the HTML file). CSS3 is the current iteration of CSS on the Web, and it adds a ton of features for things like basic interactivity and animations.

                Now, you can create a website with just HTML and CSS, but it’s <b>JavaScript</b> that’s the gamechanger (plus, it’s what’s causing all the aforementioned blurriness). To put it simply, JavaScript lets you add in interactivity, more complex animations, and even makes it possible to build fully-featured Web applications.

                Back in the day (like 2012), web browsers used to be really bad at interpreting a lot of JavaScript, so adding complex functionality with JS wasn’t always a good idea. But browsers have gotten much more powerful, making it possible to do with JavaScript what used to be reserved for “back end” programming languages. And there have been advances in JavaScript itself (including the creation of frameworks like AngularJs, jQuery, and Node.js). In short, what happened is that what we mean by “front end” development has radically changed in just a few short years.

                It’s the Internet, what can we say!

                In short, front end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to code up websites. They’re the ones who take the design and create a functioning website from it. Some sites are only built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Other sites, however, have more code hidden away in the back end of the site, to augment or enhance the front end of the site.

                Back end developers build the “under the hood” parts of websites that users don’t interact with directly.

So what does this mean for front end vs back end? While the front end is everything the user interacts with directly, the back end is much more behind-the-scenes and can have some advantages over front end technologies for specific projects. Back end programming languages include:
            <ul>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Java</li>
            </ul>
